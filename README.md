# House Prices Prediction Project

This project focuses on building predictive models using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project was collected and downloaded from kaggle.com and aims to predict variable based on various features.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this project, you'll need the following libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install all needed libraries (hint: you can use !pip install [library] in jupyter)

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/YeralyKuatuly/MachineLearning.git
- Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook HousePrices.ipynb
In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find the Python code (HousePrices.ipynb) that loads the data from housing.csv, explores the dataset, preprocesses the data, and trains Machine Learning models for predicting house prices.
  
## Project Structure
- HousePrices.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- housing.csv: Dataset file containing the house-related features and sale prices.   

## Usage
- Open HousePrices.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Follow the instructions and code cells in the notebook to understand the data analysis process, preprocessing techniques, and model training.
- Experiment with different Machine Learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve the prediction accuracy.
